### Lyrics
(Translated/adapted by Xia Liu.)

**1. Over the Snow for Plum Blossoms  
Poet: Liu Xue’an (1905-1985)  
Composer: Huang Zi (1904-1938)**

Snow wanes, the day so fine;  
The winter plum blossoms, sweet as wine.  
On my donkey, o’er the bridge,  
The bell goes tinkling-tine.
Tinkling-tine! Tinkling-tine!  
Tinkling-tine! Tinkling-tine!  
O flowers, gleaned for a vase of mine,  
Be with me while I read or chime,  
We’ll share a time divine.

**2. The Flower or the Haze  
Poet: Bai Juyi (772-846)  
Composer: Huang Zi (1904-1938)**

Not a flower, nor haze,  
It comes at midnight hours and goes with starry rays.  
It comes like vernal dreams that cannot stay,  
And goes like morning clouds that melt away.  

**3. Missing Home  
Poet: Wei Hanzhang (1905-1993)  
Composer: Huang Zi (1904-1938)**

Willow silk is green, just after the Qingming,  
leaning on the railing, alone and speechless  
let alone the cuckoo singing outside the wall,  
"It is better to go home!"  
Aroused all kinds of feelings, full of other thoughts,  
Ask the fallen flower: "flow with the gentle wave to the south?"  
I would like to go with him!

**4. Longing for the Beloved in Spring  
Poet: Wei Hanzhang (1905-1993)  
Composer: Huang Zi (1904-1938)**

Rain drops falling on the front steps  
Keep me awake all night  
The mirror this morning  
Still shows the faint dimples  
My hair falls back limply  
Without any ornaments

Here I am alone in the house  
It is hard not to see the willows  
Swaying against my drapers  
How I envy those clueless swallows  
Chirping and flitting past my windows

By now, my love has left for years  
why can’t I turn into a cuckoo  
and call him to raise horsewhip soon.

**5. Listening to Rain  
Poet: Liu Bannong (1891-1934)  
Composer: Zhao Yuanren (1892-1982)**

I have been in the north for half a year,  
and just heard raining today.  
If the rain moves south of the Yangtze River,  
How many new bamboo shoots would grow in the home garden?

**7. Joy of Snowflakes  
Poet: Xu Zhimo (1897-1931)  
Composer: Ran Tianhao (1973-)**

Were I a snowflake,  
A graceful dancer in the air,  
I'd make my way clear—  
Soar, soar, soar—  
I see my way on the earth down there.  

I'd never head for some cold valley  
Or some desolate mountain so lonely,  
And the empty street I won’t linger ,  
Soar, soar, soar—  
You see I know my way so clear.

Gracefully dancing in mid-air  
I spot the peace place she dwells,  
Waiting for her presence in the garden  
Soar, soar, soar—  
Oh, her delicate aroma of plum blossom.  
Then with the lightness of myself  
Gently, I stick to her skirt,  
So close with her soft rippled heart--  
Melt, melt, melt,--  
Melt into the gentle wave of herself.

**8. Song of the Yue Boatman  
Poet: Unknown, 528 BC?  
Composer: Liu Qing (1974-)**

Oh! What night is tonight,  
we are rowing on the river.  
Oh! What day is today,  
that I get to share a boat with a prince  
The prince's kindness makes me shy,  
I take no notice of people's mocking cries  
Ignorant but not uncared for,  
I made acquaintance with a prince.  
There are trees on the mountains and there are branches on the tree  
I adore you, oh! you do not know.

**9. Parting Tune at the Yangguan Pass**  
This is a parting tune at the Yangguan Pass with a thrice repeated refrain (Sandie). Yangguan Sandie is an ancient Chinese song, also known as Yangguan Song or Weicheng Song. The song is based on Wang Wei's (699-759) seven-character quatrains "Seeing off Yuan Er on His Mission to Anxi" : 

Morning rain at Weicheng has the light dust sprinkled clean;  
Refreshing green willow brightens th' travelers inn.  
Empty one more cup of farewell wine, I pray thee,  
West of Yangguan you’ll have no more friends like me.  

The poem was composed as a Guqin song in the Tang Dynasty. It was divided into three sections and sung in addition to the original poem, with some words developed from the original poem, which was widely sung by the Liyuan musicians at that time. In the poem, "West of Yangguan you’ll have no more friends like me " is sung three times, hence the name "Yangguan Sandie".

**11. A Glass of Wine**  

My love is like a glass of wine, a glass of wine  
Sweetheart, please accept it  
The eagle on the Tianshan Mountains will only hover but will not fly away  
Lovers surround me and don't want to leave  
Ah...lover  
Your appearance always attracts me  
I am suffering for you  
Please accept a glass of wine from my heart  
a glass of wine, a sweet wine, a scented wine  
Drink it, it will definitely be drunk you  


**12. In the Silver Moonlight**

On that golden sandy shore which was fully sprinkled with silver moonlight,  
I was looking for the traces of past happenings,  
However, the traces of past happenings were vast and indistinct.

The traces of happenings were vast and indistinct,  
They were just like fantasies and dreams  
Where were you hiding? The lady who abandoned me

I am riding on the horse, flying like a sword  
Fly, fly my horse toward the direction where she went away


**13. Mayra**  
"Mayila" (Mayra) is a Kazakh folk song, collected and adapted by Wang Luobin (1913-1996).

People call me Ma Yi La, Poet Mayra;  
Teeth white, Voice good, Singer Mayra.  
When I am happy, I sing a song,  
play my Dongbula, Dongbula.  
coming and going poeple  
are crowding under my roof,  
Mayra, Mayra  

I am the chief’s girl named Mayra  
The edges of my white handkerchief  
are embroidered roses.  
Young Kazakhs,  
all envy me, envy me,  
whose singing can compete with mine.  
Mayra, Mayra  

The edges of my white handkerchief  
are embroidered roses,  
who can sing like Mayra  
Young Kazakhs,  
All know me, know me,  
They are running from the far away mountains,  
Mayra, Mayra  

**15. Jasmine Flower**

How we adore pretty jasmine flowers!  
How we adore pretty jasmine flowers!  
Fond and moreish over branches  
You share your fame all ranges  
Lower you and gently pick down  
Soon give you to doors ajar.  
Jasmine flowers are never afar.  

**16. When Will the Locust Tree Bloom**

There is a locust tree on a high mountain,  
looking at the man with the railing in her hand.  
The mother asked: “What are you looking for?”  
The daughter: “I am watching when will the locust tree bloom.”  

**17. Back from the Fair  
Lyrics: Gu Di (1932-2013)  
Composer: Huang Youyi (?-)**

The sunset comes Alili  
the fair ends Alili  
Back home joyfully  
Alili, Alili, back from the fair Alili  

Sweet as honey, Alili  
Wonderful life, Alili  
Beautiful as a flower Alili  
Yi girl Alili  
Alili, Alili, back from the fair Alili  

A silver necklace Alili,  
A gold ring Alili  
Dress a girl Alili  
More beautiful Alili  
Alili, Alili, back from the fair Alili  

The birds are singing Alili  
Singing with us Alili   
The sunset clouds Alili  
are flying Alili   
Alili, Alili, back from the fair Alili
