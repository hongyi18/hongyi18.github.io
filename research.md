## Research interests

My publication and research profile can be found at [my INSPIRE profile](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1790638?ui-citation-summary=true).


### Ultralight dark matter theory and phenomenology

Ordinary matter constitutes a 16% of total matter in our universe, with the remaining 84% designated as dark matter (DM). How does DM originate, evolve and  lead to our present-day universe? How does DM interact with itself, ordinary matter, and gravity? How to probe it using cosmological and astrophysical environments? I seek to answer these questions, with special focuses on fields and particles that are lighter than 10eV, the so called ultralight DM.


### Probing new physics with compact objects

While terrestrial experiments have been successful in establishing the standard model of particle physics, astrophysical compact objects are more powerful labs for probing physics beyond it thanks to their high temperatures, intense magnetic fields, etc. I am interested in how new physics processes are manifested in these extreme conditions, aiming to discover potential signatures they could imprint.


### Nonlinear dynamics in cosmology

Nonlinear dynamics is fascinating. It lies at the borderline between predictability and unpredictability, encompassing a rich phenomenology and providing a unique regime to develop physical and mathematical techniques. I am excited to explore nonlinear processes of cosmological fields, such as preheating, structure formation, soliton dynamics, parametric resonance, etc.
