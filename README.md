This is my webpage project. The details of the build process is introduced [here]({% post_url 2021-08-16-how-to-make-a-personal-website-on-github %}).

### Website structure

The main pages of the site include:

- index.md
- research.md
- teaching.md
- activities.md
- blog.md
	+ _posts/ (Directory to store posts. Name convention: "2023-09-04-my-post.md")
- personal.md

Each of the main page has a corresponding folder to store the used files and assets. The website is built based on the template Minima v2.5.1. The file structure for site settings is as follows

- _includes/ (Reusable components like headers, footers, and social links)
- _layouts/ (Main HTML layouts that define page structure)
	+ default.html (Default layout for all pages)
	+ home.html (Layout for homepage)
	+ page.html (Layout for pages except the homepage)
	+ blog.html (Layout for the blog page that lists all posts)
	+ post.html (Layout for posts)
- _sass/ and assets/ (Style files to define the website's appearance)
- .editorconfig (Define consistent coding styles across different text editors and IDEs)
- .gitignore (Specify patterns of files and directories to be ignored when committing to the repository)
- _config.yml (Main configuration file for site settings)
- 404.html (For pages that do not exist on the server)
- Gemfile (Define which gems are required by the application)
- minima.gemspec (Define the metadata and dependencies of a gem)

In local repository, there could be cache files generated by Jekyll and Git, including
- .git (Track changes, including commit history, branches, tags, etc.)
- .jekyll-cache (Store pre-generated website files to speed up the build process)
- _site (Store the compiled HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files of your website)
- Gemfile.lock (Record the exact versions that were installed to avoid inconsistent dependencies)

Usually it is not suggested to modify these files once the repository has been built locally.
